Benoit is an extremely flexible framework and representation for neural networks. It is licensed under the LGPL v3, copyright John Wendell Hall 7/23/2011. Current release date: 8/18/2011. I'll decide on a permanent version number scheme as soon as I deem Benoit to be in a useable form. 

Benoit comes in two parts: (1) a network structure and interface in the form of a set of virtual base classes, and (2) an implementation of neural network computations built on top of it. As of this release, Part 1 is very nearly done. Part 2 is definitely better than halfway done, but not as close as part one. All the classes I've written are now documented, though I may add more detail later.
