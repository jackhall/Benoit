Benoit is an extremely flexible framework and representation for distributed networks and graphs. I plan to use it as the basis for a multithreaded neural networks library, among other things. Benoit is great for when you want heterogeneous software objects to talk via a polymorphic interface. The objects need know nothing about each other, save that they each own a ben::Node of the same type. 

Benoit is licensed under the GPL v3, copyright John Wendell Hall 7/23/2011. Current release date: 2/12/2012. 
Version numbers are three-field like so: benoit-x.y.z
x will only change with major overhauls. 
y will change when functionality is modified. 
z will change with bug fixes and other minor alterations. 
The current version is: 1.2.0 

To test, compile test/test_benoit.cpp with:
	g++ -std=c++0x -g -I ../src test_benoit.cpp -o test
and run the result with:
	./test

Benoit is made up of three templated classes: Node, Link, and Index. All classes exist in the "ben" namespace. Since Benoit is a header-only library, all you have to do is #include Benoit.h to use it. Implementation details are documented in the source files, but I've included a quick overview here.

Node instances are the verticies of the directed graph. They are intended to network across threads; Benoit will be thread-safe and multithreaded (by version 2 if not 1). Make it a member of any class which you want to communicate across a distributed network. A given class may contain any number of Nodes for connecting to different networks. Data to be sent is pushed into the Node, and data to be received is pulled out. Nodes may be publicly constructed and deleted. Safe destruction is ensured by signalling the Index to clean up after it.

Link instances are invisible to the user. They implement thread-safe message passing between Nodes. Links may be manipulated indirectly through one of the Nodes it links by creating a port object, which is a cross between a stream and an iterator. 

Index instances manage a subset of Nodes and the Links between them. Nodes may not link between Indicies. An Index is required to work with any Nodes, but default construction of a Node will automatically use a static Index for ease of use. Nodes may be swapped between Indicies, but all Links involving that Node will be deleted unless the entire network is transferred. These rules limit the possibility for semantic errors.
